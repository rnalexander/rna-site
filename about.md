Hello!  My name is Ryan Alexander, and this is finally some kind of personal web-presence, as opposed to just an ongoing social media presence.

I'm currently the Lead back-end developer for the [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk).

This is all a bit bare bones at the moment.  You'll probably reconize this all as the base [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme.  More fancier stuff should be coming later but for right now I hope this will do.  Minimum Viable Website and all that.
