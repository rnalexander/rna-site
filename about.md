Ryan is currently the Lead back-end developer for the [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk) based in London.  He's been helping organise large-to-small scale community events for a quarter of a century. He is passionate about inclusion, diversity, giving people the best chance to do their best, and believes that empathy is the key to making that happen.  He's also fond of board gaming and cocktails in case he's getting too sincere and you'd like to distract him onto a different topic.

His pronouns are He/Him/His.

He looks a bit like this:
