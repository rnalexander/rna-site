Last night I gave a talk on Accelerating Others at the [Extreme Programmers London meetup][x-pro-lo], held in the lovely offices of [Unruly][unruly]!

I had a really nice time and appreciated all of the excellent questions and conversations following the talk.  In particular I appreciated the feedback and will be using it to make the talk even better.

As I expressed in the presention (the slide deck for which can be found <a href="{{ "/assets/2017-09-01_Accelerating_Others_talk_V1.0.key" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>) I'm always looking for companies to speak with about ther processes, and other chances to speak.  If you'd be interested in either, please let me know!

Many thanks to [Sarah C Y][scy] for the invitation to speak!
