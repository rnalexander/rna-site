I'm going to be speaking at this year's [Lead Developer conference][lead-dev-2016]!

This is my first time doing a professional speaking engagement.  I've spoken many times at unconferences and events, usually at Barcamps and the occasional [Socrates conference][socrates-uk], but this time it's all professional and stuff!  I'm quite excited!
