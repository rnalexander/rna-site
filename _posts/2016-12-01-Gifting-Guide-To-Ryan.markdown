Every year in the middle of trying to figure out what to get folks for the holidays it occurs to me that I should write something about gifting me back.  Now that I have a nominal site in my own name, I figured this was a good place to put this down in a more permanent fashion.

So here is the Gifting Guide to Ryan:

Give me no gift that incurs you debt.

Small is better than big.

Consumable is better than permanent.

It really is the thought that counts, not the cost.

No really, you can literally share a thought with me, something about you that lets me know you better, or a memory we share that reminds me of us.

If you gift me booze Iâ€™ll likely make you a cocktail with it.

Sending me expensive stuff from the US to the UK yourself stands a good chance of incurring me import fees.

If all else fails and you need a quick win, I have a [wish list][amazon-wish-list] on Amazon UK under my name.
