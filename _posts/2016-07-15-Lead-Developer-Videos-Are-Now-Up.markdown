The videos of the talks (including mine!) from this year's [Lead Developer conference][lead-dev-2016] are [now up on vimeo][lead-dev-vimeo-talks].

They're all really good, [but if you're just looking for mine it's here.][rna-lead-dev-2016-talk]

My slides are very visible in the talk but they're [here if you'd like them on their own][speakerdeck-talk], please let me know what you think!
